                                            For this project, we mainly used three coding languages: python, HTML, and CSS. In our group, everyone has a different knowledge level about coding. Some people had expose to CSS and HTML, some were expects in python, and others were clueless. It was hard to learn everything about these coding languages, given the time-frame we had to create this masterpiece. We encountered many issues and errors, some being complicated while others were due to the annoyances of our coding platform. Luckily, we had help from each other, as well as our mentor, Cameron Jackson, and the lovely internet to help guide us in the right direction.

                                             In the beginning, it was a bit awkward as we worked over Zoom, and we all know how awkward Zoom meetings can be. But, as the days went by, we were able to create a sense of familiarity and connection through similar interests (such as crocheting cute mushrooms [talking about you, Cam the Mushroom] and having similar experiences in school). The final linkage may have been the discussion of which theme to use, as we freely voiced our opinions and had our shares of laughs, In all seriousness, we all had the same end goal: to create an AI product that can be displayed. With the same goal in mind, we all collaborated and persevered to create this wonderful website.

                                          Our daily schedule for a couple of weeks often consisted of some lectures, and then coding and work time. One way that we were able to stay focused and on-task was through a system of ten-minute breaks every hour. This helped us clear our minds, and then regroup. We also split up our six member team into two groups. This allowed us to clearly divide up action items and pursue multiple creative directions.<p>

                                             During our exploratory data analysis, we often struggled with finding high-quality data. A notable example is a Life Expectancy dataset we initially attempted to work with, which contained deeply flawed values-population for certain countries would inexplicably jump up hundreds of thousands between one year and the next! We learned to vet the datasets we utilized for accuracy. Beyond this, it was a struggle to find <i>enough</i> data to understand population trends and supplement machine learning models. One way we mitigated this was by analyzing population data from both a 6 Continents dataset and a 25 Most Populated Countries dataset.

                                            <strong>Decision trees just weren't very good at predicting our continuous data</strong>
                                            Decision trees work by classifying different inputs into distinct outputs. By adding more layers, we can make the decision tree predict more outputs to our hearts content. For example, if we wanted to predict your biological sex, we wouldn't need a very deep tree, however if we were trying to predict how old you were, we would need a drastically deeper tree. Effectively, they can't predict a continuous but can get infinitely close to predicting a continuous function as the depth of the tree increases. Because our data was so sporadic and all over the place, we would need an absurdly deep decision tree to get even close to what a polynomial regression model could do easily. There is a trade off however, the polynomial regression performs worse in extreme situations, ie making predictions 100 years from now.

                                            <strong>To get significant amount of data, we used the country and continent data sets.</strong>
                                             But that is not all. By using a country’s data set, we were able to get a better understanding of the smaller trends that may have been hidden among the wider continental trends. However, we couldn’t combine the data together. When creating different data visualizations and machine learning models with combined data sets, the models could not create a proper regression line. This means that the model couldn’t predict and create an accurate trend. With this, it was more logical to create seperate models for each country/continent.

                                            Neural networks are super popular in the media and research papers, but they aren't always the best. Despite the almost magical capabilities of a well made neural network, in this model it turned out to be more trouble than it was worth. While it's almost certainly possible to create a neural network sophisticated enough to outperform other models on our data, we found that for the time invested, neural networks just weren't worth it.

                                            Standard Deviation, or std, let us know the overall deviation of the data from the mean, or average. The MAE, or Mean Absolute Error, told us the magnitude of difference between the actual value, and the machine learning model's predicted value. Similarly to the MAE, we used the MSE (Mean Squared Error) for our Polynomial Regression Model. This is the mean, or average, of the squares of all errors. By comparing the MAE or MSE to the Standard Deviation, we were able to understand how reasonable our model's predictions were; we aimed to have our MAE be at most 50% of the standard deviation. The score is another metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of a machine learning, where values close to 1 are a positive indicator of accuracy. It uses the coefficient of determination (R^2).
